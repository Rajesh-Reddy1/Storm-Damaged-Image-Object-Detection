<!-- ABOUT THE CHALLENGE -->
## About The Challenge

The EY Open Science Data Challenge 2024 presents an opportunity for participants to leverage high-resolution pre and post-event satellite imagery to assess the damage inflicted by tropical cyclones on coastal infrastructure.

The goal is to build a machine learning model capable of identifying and classifying buildings as 'damaged' or 'undamaged' across residential and commercial zones.

This project includes a demonstration notebook to serve as a starting point, utilizing YOLOv8 for object detection.

### Built With

This project was built with the following frameworks and libraries:

* [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
* [LabelMe2Yolo](https://pypi.org/project/labelme2yolo/)
* [Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/)
* [GDAL](https://gdal.org/)

<!-- CHALLENGE STRUCTURE -->
## Challenge Structure

The project consists of annotated datasets, a YAML configuration file, and a trained YOLOv8 model. The file structure and preparation steps are thoroughly documented in the provided Jupyter Notebook, enabling participants to structure their own dataset and configuration for model training.
